# KubSka
Profile repository

### My JS description :
class Person:
    def __init__(self, username, job, coding_languages):
        self.username = username
        self.job = job
        self.coding_languages = coding_languages

    def details(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.username}")
        print(f"I'm a {self.job} at the moment")
        print(f"I'm actually work in {self.coding_languages}")

me = Person("KubSka", "Student", "Python")
me.details()

Output :
```txt
Hello, my name is KubSka
I'm a student at the moment
I'm actually work in Python
```
